# JOB HUNTER 

It's a platform that allows users to keep track of their job applications. Users can register and sign in, and start adding, updating, and deleting their job applications. It also provides some free resources to be used as guidance on how to build a resume, cover letter, and how to get ready for interviews.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular 16, NodeJs, ExpressJS, MongoDB, JWT.

As a Front-End Developer, I always want to challenge myself, and that is what I did here in this project. While I was designing this application, I was thinking about which technology I wanted to practice or learn. I thought about building a Fullstack application and learning a little bit of backend to see how that works. I did it, and I am so happy that I chose to do it because I learned so much. Now I feel pretty comfortable with the backend using Node.js. I love learning new skills and using them. It is so satisfying.

## Lessons Learned

It doesn't matter how much you know or don't know; always keep a good mindset and focus on finding the solution to any problem you may encounter. Keep track of them and review how you resolved them. Next time, if the same issue happens again, you will be able to address it easily.

## Examples
Take a look at these couple example that I have in my own portfolio:
