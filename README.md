# Job Hunter

In this project, I developed a demo application called "Job Hunter" which facilitates users in their job search process. Hereâ€™s what I did:


### 1. User Authentication:

- Implemented functionality for users to register and log in to their accounts.

### 2. Dashboard Development:

- Created a dashboard that displays a list of job platforms for users to explore job opportunities.
- Included a search bar that allows users to search for jobs by company name.

### 3. Job Application Management:

- Developed features for users to add new job applications or job submissions.
- Provided functionality to delete and update existing job applications.

### 4. Resource Section:
- Added a section with useful resources to help users build their resumes, prepare for job interviews, and write cover letters.

Overall, this project aims to streamline the job search process by offering a centralized platform with essential tools and resources for job seekers.
